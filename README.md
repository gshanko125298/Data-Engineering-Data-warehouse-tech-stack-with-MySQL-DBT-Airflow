# Apache Airflow!
Apache Airflow Core, which includes webserver, scheduler, CLI and other components that are needed for minimal Airflow installation. Read the documentation »
Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

Use airflow to author workflows as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of tasks. The airflow scheduler executes your tasks on an array of workers while following the specified dependencies. Rich command line utilities make performing complex surgeries on DAGs a snap. The rich user interface makes it easy to visualize pipelines running in production, monitor progress, and troubleshoot issues when needed.

When workflows are defined as code, they become more maintainable, versionable, testable, and collaborative.

Overview

Good documentation for your dbt models will help downstream consumers discover and understand the datasets which you curate for them.

dbt provides a way to generate documentation for your dbt project and render it as a website. The documentation for your project includes:

    Information about your project: including model code, a DAG of your project, any tests you've added to a column, and more.
    Information about your data warehouse: including column data types, and table sizes. This information is generated by running queries against the information schema.

Importantly, dbt also provides a way to add descriptions to models, columns, sources, and more, to further enhance your documentation.
